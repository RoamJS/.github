# RoamJS

The suite of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) extensions built and maintained by RoamJS.

RoamJS helps you turn Roam into a full operating environment for thinking and work: automation, integrations, visual tools, and advanced workflows.

## Extensions

### Automation and Workflow

- [Autotag](https://github.com/RoamJS/autotag): Automatically tags pages and links exact page references as you write, keeping your graph organized with less manual cleanup.
- [SmartBlocks](https://github.com/RoamJS/smartblocks): Build programmable templates and workflows to automate repeated writing, planning, and graph operations.
- [TODO Trigger](https://github.com/RoamJS/todo-trigger): Run automatic actions when a task changes state (for example `TODO` to `DONE`), such as styling, timestamps, and task filing.

### Navigation, Search, and Analysis

- [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/RoamJS/breadcrumbs): Adds a clickable trail of recent pages and blocks so you can jump back quickly and navigate with context.
- [Query Builder](https://github.com/RoamJS/query-builder): Create powerful graph queries with a visual builder, advanced logic, and table/kanban-style result views.
- [Stats](https://github.com/RoamJS/stats): Get fast graph analytics such as page counts, words, links, and tag usage in a compact dashboard.
- [Workbench](https://github.com/RoamJS/workbench): A broad power-user toolkit for navigation, command palette enhancements, previews, mind maps, OCR, and more.
